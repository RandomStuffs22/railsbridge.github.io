        <h2>Bridge Foundry is working to improve the state of tech, especially for humans.</h2>
        <p>Technology gets better with more diversity. So we help organizations who train, mentor, and encourage diverse groups of
          people to get involved in technology.</p>
        <p>Does your organization need help fundraising or organizing events?
          Bridge Foundry is a project of <a href="http://schoolfactory.org/">School Factory</a>, and can help you
          accept tax-deductible donations. We also have a lot of experience
          teaching, mentoring, organizing, and having fun, and we love to share
          our expertise, so drop us a line!</p>

        <h2>About Bridge Foundry</h2>
        <p>
          Bridge Foundry was formed in late 2012 by the people who make <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org">RailsBridge</a> workshops happen.
          We'd been thinking about pursuing 501(c)3 non-profit status, and after some research into
          the mountains of paperwork and infrastructure required, chose to find a fiscal sponsor instead.
          (In the United States, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship">fiscal sponsor</a> is a non-profit that extends its tax-exempt status to
          partner organizations.)</p>

        <p>Rather than just securing non-profit status for RailsBridge, we realized we had an opportunity to help other
        organizations that are doing similar work in a variety of tech communities. And so Bridge Foundry was born:
        a parent organization that RailsBridge could create for itself and other groups.</p>

        <p>School Factory's mission is to transform education,
        and two of the ways they do that is through the <a href="http://schoolfactory.org/spacefed">Space Federation</a>
         , a collection of hacker and maker spaces,
        and through <a href="http://schoolfactory.org/node/5">Emergentcy Schools</a>, "programs that engage people in the creation of communities of practice &mdash; focused on a culture of creativity, constructivism, and project-based learning." School Factory's executive director James Carlson
        is helping Bridge Foundry establish its long-term goals as well as providing the non-profit status that will
        help smaller groups accept tax-deductible donations.</p>

        <h2>Helping!</h2>
        <p>Bridge Foundry is a 100% volunteer effort, and we can always use donations of time, treasure, or talent.
        If you're interested in helping, please drop us a line at [email address].</p>
        <p>We're especially interested in making connections with groups that are working to make tech a better industry
        and could benefit from our tax-exempt status. [how to get in touch]</p>

        <h2>Processes</h2>
        <p>Working with Bridge Foundry means that donations are made directly to School Factory (usually by check or PayPal),
        and that the School Factory staff then works with the individual group to distribute the funds as needed.</p>
        <p>RailsBridge, which puts on free Rails workshops, has published their policies <a href="https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/wiki/Money-Things">
          on their wiki</a>. If your organization
        could benefit from a similar set up, please get in touch! [ + how to get in touch]</p>
